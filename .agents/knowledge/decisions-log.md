# Decisions Log — Tài Sản Đấu Giá (taisandaugia)

> **History file — grep, don't auto-read.** Reverse-chronological (newest first). This is the audit trail of *why*; the canonical *what* lives in the current-truth files (`architecture.md` / `business-rules.md` / `design-system.md` / `component-registry.md` / `common-pitfalls.md`). **Rule: this log records only WHY.** When a decision establishes or changes a rule, update the rule file too — if a rule lives only here, agents won't find it and it is effectively lost. Use `/log-decision`.
> Format per entry: `## YYYY-MM-DD — Short title`, then **Context** (the problem / why now), **Decision** (what we chose), **Consequences** (follow-ups, obligations, what it makes true).

## 2026-07-05 — Decouple Lovable, migrate to native Supabase Google OAuth + Vercel

**Context:** The app originated on the Lovable AI platform and shipped with Lovable-specific auth and build shims — `@lovable.dev/cloud-auth-js` wrapping sign-in and the `lovable-tagger` Vite plugin. Now deployed on **Vercel** with a standalone Supabase project (`bcusbpkfnydqcvxxjvew`), that coupling was dead weight and a lock-in risk, and the wrapped auth blocked using Supabase's own OAuth.
**Decision:**
- Removed `@lovable.dev/cloud-auth-js` and `lovable-tagger` from `package.json` and `vite.config.ts`.
- `AuthDialog` now calls **`supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })`** directly via the typed client (`src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`); the multi-step identifier→OTP/password flow stays, Google is added as a first-class provider. Auth remains globally driven by `AuthDialogContext` + `AuthProvider` (single auth source — do not add parallel `getSession`/subscriptions).
- Hosting/build is now plain Vite → Vercel; no Lovable-injected tags in the bundle.
**Consequences:**
- **Ops obligation:** enable the **Google provider** in Supabase Auth (client ID/secret) and **whitelist the Vercel domains** (production + preview URLs) in Supabase Auth → URL Configuration (Site URL + Redirect URLs), or OAuth redirects 400. Google Cloud OAuth consent screen must list the same redirect URIs.
- Preview deploys use ephemeral Vercel URLs — either add a wildcard/known preview domain to the allow-list or accept that OAuth only works on whitelisted hosts.
- Reflected in `architecture.md` (auth stack, providers, deploy target). Mock files under `src/lib/mock*.ts` remain legacy scaffolding, unaffected.

## 2026-07-05 — Adopt the 4-layer `.claude` + `.agents` management system (ported from vsf-tm)

**Context:** Solo/agent-driven work on a real production app needed a repeatable operating model — expert personas, a knowledge base that separates current-truth from history, project slash-skills, and safety hooks — instead of ad-hoc prompting. The sibling `vsf-tm` project already had a proven version; port it, adapting from vsf-tm's mock-store/no-database prototype assumptions to taisandaugia's **real Supabase + RLS + React Query** reality.
**Decision:** Installed the four layers with canonical slugs (so cross-references resolve):
1. **Personas** at `.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`: `orchestrator`, `cpo`, `cto`, `system-architect`, `qa-qc`, `ui-ux-designer`, `data-analyst`, `kyc-expert`, `credits-paywall-expert`.
2. **Thin subagent wrappers** at `.claude/agents/<name>.md` (8, no orchestrator): `cpo`, `cto`, `system-architect`, `qa` (→`qa-qc`), `ui-ux` (→`ui-ux-designer`), `data-analyst`, `kyc-expert`, `credits-paywall-expert`.
3. **Project slash-skills** at `.claude/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`: `new-page`, `migration`, `add-query`, `log-decision`, `add-unlock`.
4. **Knowledge base** at `.agents/knowledge/`: current-truth files (`architecture.md`, `business-rules.md`, `design-system.md`, `component-registry.md`, `common-pitfalls.md`) + this grep-only `decisions-log.md`, with the auto-read map in `README.md`.
- **Domain swap from vsf-tm:** HR/L&D/IDP/Excel-export content dropped. `hr-expert`→**`kyc-expert`** (3-milestone KYC, `kyc_status` PENDING_KYC→APPROVED|REJECTED, org roles Owner/Manager/Agent, RLS "own rows", CCCD/passport/phone-OTP). `ld-expert`→**`credits-paywall-expert`** (append-only `credit_transactions` ledger, `unlockAsset` permanent vs `unlockCompany`/`unlockOwner` time-limited & stacking, `unlockDeepReportPeriod` `{slug}:{periodId}` + `expandUnlock`, `PaywallContext`, `useCredits` single access point). Reports are **Recharts dashboards**, not Excel.
- Safety hooks at `.claude/hooks/`: `inject-workflow-context.sh`, `guard-main-push.sh` (advisory `ask` on push to `main`), `check-safety.sh`.
**Consequences:**
- `main` is protected **by policy**: only repo owner **@harleyng** pushes to `main`; agents branch + open a PR and don't self-merge. `guard-main-push.sh` is advisory (soft confirm), not a server-side block.
- Governance is authored assuming a real backend — reads respect RLS, writes go through the typed client and invalidate React Query keys (e.g. `["user-credits", userId]`); `system-architect` may propose schema/migrations/RLS.
- Knowledge stays discoverable only if the **current-truth ↔ history split** is honored: decisions logged here MUST be paired with an update to the canonical rule file.
